### Installation
- **Heading**: `# Installation`
- **Subheading**: `**Swing Into Action**`

The installation process is split into two main steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - **Instructions**: Clone the project from GitHub and navigate into the directory.
   - **Code Block**:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YTSlinger.git
     cd YTSlinger
     ```
   - **Note**: The URL in the image uses `yourusername`, but other references suggest the correct repository might be `https://github.com/gnotree/YTSlinger.git`.

2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   - **Subheading**: `**Spin the Web**`
   - **Instructions**: Execute a PowerShell script to set up dependencies.
   - **Code Block**:
     ```powershell
     .\setup.ps1
     ```

#### Details of the `setup.ps1` Script
A collapsible section labeled "text" provides more information about what the script does:
- Installs Anaconda 3 if it’s not already present (prompts the user with Y/N).
- Sets up a Conda environment named `%USERNAME%-ML` (e.g., `gtai8-ML`) and installs `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` within it. If Anaconda isn’t used, these dependencies are installed via `pip`.
- Prompts the user to add Anaconda to the system PATH (Y/N).
- Prompts the user to add an alias `ytsh` to their PowerShell profile (Y/N).
- **Warning**: `***Warning***: Avoid adding aliases in an Admin shell to prevent profile conflicts.`

This script automates the setup process, making it user-friendly while accommodating different system configurations.
